# YTOT v0.1.0

This is project I decided to work on when another on top player for youtube becasme compromised. This application opens a frameless window that stays on top of other windows so you can see the video playing while working.

## Technologies

This is built using the Angular4 framework and Electron.

## Releases

Releases of the full application are contained under the relases folder for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

## Future Enhancements

* HotKeys to dock to corners of current scree
* Hotkey to hide the window
* Twitch support if possible

## Mentions

The embedded youtube angular component was based off this repo: https://github.com/orizens/ng2-youtube-player
