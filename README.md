# YTOT v0.4.0

This is project I decided to work on when another on top player for youtube becasme compromised. This application opens a frameless window that stays on top of other windows so you can see the video playing while working. Now updated for enhanced Mac support.

## Installation
Currently you have to pull the repository and build yourself, if anyone needs I can go back to providing compiled versions in the repository. Just let me know.

## Technologies

This is built using the Angular 7 framework and Electron.

## Finished Enhancements

* Added playlist support
* Added playlist index support
* Upgraded to Angular 5

## Future Enhancements

* HotKeys to dock to corners of current screen
* Hotkey to hide the window
* Twitch support if possible

## Mentions

The embedded youtube angular component was based off this repo: https://github.com/orizens/ng2-youtube-player
